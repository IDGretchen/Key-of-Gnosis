As a newly minted Cultural Anthropologist, you have been studying the effects of climate change on smaller, less globally connected populations. You have been away from home now for a few weeks, gathering information from places like the rural American mid-west, all the way to the eagle hunters of western Mongolia. You have been doing ethnography to see if you can find patterns in how climate change is changing lives all over the world. The work is hard, but it&#39;s been amazing to go to all these places, and you have gathered so many stories....

One of your last stops is in North Tamred. You are excited to go to the town, though you don&#39;t know much about the area. 
So, you pack up to make the 3 hour bus trip to the Tamred’s main community, armed with your pack, journal, and voice recorder. You list out what you know: this is closed community. They are open to trade and interaction with outsiders, but keep their cultural traditions private. Their isolated community is being negatively affected by climate change, causing younger Tamred’s to move into the cities, loosing contact with their traditions.

Hoping to get a bit more insight, you reached out to a faculty member who you knew had some experience in the area, many years ago. 

&quot;Tamred, huh? Quite the place! I wasn&#39;t there long, but I know they are a pretty closed community. I mean, they interact and work in the surrounding cities, but they keep their cultural traditions to themselves. If you can bring back any real information on their culture, it could make your name in certain circles. In fact.... There&#39;s a story of a particular artifact, something they call the &#39;Key&#39;. The Hibler museum has representations of similar artifacts from neighboring societies. If you could bring them one from the Tamred you could almost be certain that you could get all the funding you wanted for your research. You could go //anywhere//. Write your own ticket. Just think about collecting the artifact while you&#39;re collecting data.&quot;

The thought of the artifact digs at you for the long bus ride, and the following hike. It’s still on your mind as you walk up the busy main street into a humble looking town.

The street is unexpectedly crowded. Sure, everything you’ve read about the area says that this is an active little town, but this is more than just active. There are people walking along the street, hands full of baskets and bags, a mix of traditional dress and American style jeans. You get a few odd looks – and one or two somewhat unfriendly glares, but the people seem too busy to be much bothered by your uninvited presence.  

You can see some people stopping here and there, shopping at little booths set up along the road, and the doors to a nearby shop of some sort stand open, people moving in and out with purpose.  They go in empty handed, but come out carrying a small wrapped bundle.

A little bit further down the street, there is a group of kids kicking a soccer ball around. One of the few trucks you have seen in the town blows its horn, maneuvering around the kids, as it slowly putters up the crowed street deeper into the village.

You decide to go to the shop, and nod and smile at the busy customers as you pass through the door.

Inside the light is less harsh than the bright sun on the street, and it takes your eyes a second to adjust. Around you are shelves lined with the normal cans and boxes that you are used to seeing, but there are also long cabinets stocked with jars and boxes and small bags of powders and plants you don&#39;t easily recognize. There are bundles of herbs, and flowers, as well as packs of what look like dried animal parts, mysterious liquids, and a variety of what seem to be seeds and/or stones. 

The smell in the shop is a kind of pleasing mix of wood and something ...huskier. And the people are happily chatting away as you slowly make your way to what seems to be the main counter.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Kids" tags="" position="238,393" size="100,100">You think that kids are generally pretty approachable, and decide to go chat with them.

The kids look up as you approach, watching you carefully but with more curiosity than worry.  They stop their game, waiting for you. 

You smile as you approach. “Hello. I hope I’m not bothering you?”

The biggest one puts a foot on the ball. “No, we are just messing around. Who are you? Why are you here?”

“I’m from the States. I wanted to talk to the people who live here, about your town, and how you live.”

The kid kicks at the ball, bouncing it a bit. “Well, no one will have time to talk to you today.”
“Yeah, they seem pretty busy…?”

The youngest pipes up, “It’s the festival today. Everyone is busy.”

“Festival?”

But the older child has shushed the little one, and the other kids are frowning. “The festival isn’t for outsiders,” the oldest says, picking up the soccer ball. “We shouldn’t talk to you.”

Curious, you reach out and catch the eye of a woman passing by. “Excuse me –“

You beak off as she stops, glaring at you. “How dare you! I don’t know you! You should not just speak to a person you do not know without an introduction!”

You step back quickly, surprised by her angry reaction.

(text-style:&quot;condense&quot;)+(text-colour:purple)[&#39;&#39;Notes about this interaction&#39;&#39;:
The stricture about needing a proper introduction to speak is actually from Western/European history. Making introductions can be a very tricky social process. In regency- age England for example (where many of our American introduction-related traditions come from) making introductions was a strictly controlled process. Women, for example, should never be introduced to strangers without deep social understanding of the family and personal history of both women, and even then introductions should always be done only with permission, and by other women. This is because, for both men and women in England, introductions were serious business. If you allowed someone to be presented (introduced) to you, then you were accepting a social relationship with that person. One that couldn’t be taken back.

According to Freeling’s The Pocket Book of Etiquette (1837):
//A proper introduction entitles you to the good offices of the person to whom you are introduced; it is therefore a circumstance of importance, and the necessary forms must be attended to.//

Until a ‘formal’ introduction had taken place, it was as if two people did not know each other. They could not speak casually until the introduction had been made.]

I can tell from the accent and the attitude. I just told you that it isn’t right for use to speak without a proper introduction. Worse, it could be dagerious! For both of us. Go find someone of your own caste. Do not bother me again.”

(text-style:&quot;condense&quot;)+(text-colour:purple)[&#39;&#39;Notes on this interaction:&#39;&#39;
Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a style of life which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution.

The use of that word might be a clue that this person may have diffrent or more rigid social requirements than someone else.]

&lt;audio src=&quot;https://github.com/IDGretchen/Key-of-Gnosis/raw/main/Freesoundmediumcrowd.mp3&quot; autoplay&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" Information" tags="" position="4,521" size="100,100">The person softens a bit. &quot;You are a stranger here. I understand you might not know our ways, but you need to be more careful about how you approach others. I am of a caste that, if I was younger, talking to you without proper introduction could lead me to suffering socially. Be more careful on who you speak to. You are not the only one who might suffer from your lack of understanding. 

“If you would like to ask for information, look for those who make it their business to talk to others.&quot;

The person turns and strides away, and you hold back the urge to say ‘thank you’. //Your// culture says that saying thanks is required to be polite, but the person has made it clear that speaking can have ramifications for them that you are not aware of. It’s probably best to just let them go.

The oldest on smiles a bit. &quot;You might be okay,&quot; he concedes. &quot;You might be able to come to the festival. But if you do, you need to have your //matan//.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s a //matan//?&quot;

The kids laugh. &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s a //matan//. What do you mean, what is it? Just go get one!&quot;

&quot;Where should I go?&quot;

The kids laugh again, almost at the corner now. &quot;At the store, //tashi//!&quot;

The kids explode with laughter, breaking into a run, sprinting away.

You are left alone in the street, slightly amused and slightly irritated. You wonder what a //matan// is... and what //tashi// means, and pull out your notebook to make sure you remember the words.

Many of the customers in the busy store all seem to be picking up one of the small wrapped bundles you observed people carrying as you entered town. Each bundle seems to have been created for a specific person. You have heard many of the customers use the word //matan// and you take out your notebook to jot it down. Maybe you can ask someone what it means?

Finally your turn comes up, but you hesitate, not sure of your welcome in interrupting what is a very busy day for the clerk. But the clerk smiles at you in a friendly enough way, and so you step forward.
